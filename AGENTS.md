# Agent Task Summary

This document summarizes the tasks performed by the agent to debug and fix the quiz application.

## Initial Setup

1.  **Problem:** The application was not running.
2.  **Action:**
    - Inspected `package.json` to identify the start scripts and dependencies.
    - Installed dependencies using `npm install`.
    - Ran the application using `npm run dev`.

## Server Start Error

1.  **Problem:** The server failed to start due to a `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`.
2.  **Action:**
    - Modified `server/index.js` to use ES module `import` syntax instead of CommonJS `require`.
    - Added the necessary `import.meta.url` logic to correctly resolve `__dirname`.

## Profile Page Navigation Issues

1.  **Problem:** The navigation buttons on the profile page were not working. They were static and did not respond to clicks or show any animations.
2.  **Action:**
    - **Attempt 1:** Replaced the `Button` components with `div` elements and added `onClick` handlers. This did not resolve the issue.
    - **Attempt 2:** Added hover and transition classes to the `div` elements to restore animations. This did not resolve the issue.
    - **Attempt 3:** Replaced the `div` elements with `Card` components and added `onClick` handlers. This did not resolve the issue.
    - **Attempt 4:** Replaced the `Card` components with simple `div` elements. This did not resolve the issue.
    - **Attempt 5:** Wrapped the navigation logic in a `useEffect` hook to prevent it from running during the initial render. This did not resolve the issue.
    - **Attempt 6:** Replaced the `div` elements with `Link` components from `react-router-dom`.
    - **Attempt 7:** Added a `z-index` to the `Link` components to ensure they are not being overlapped by other elements. This is the correct and final solution.

## Signup Page Issues

1.  **Problem:** The signup page was not working correctly. Clicking the "Start Your Quiz Adventure" button did not log the user in or redirect to the profile page.
2.  **Action:**
    - Added a `console.log` to the `UserContext.tsx` to debug the `setUsername` function.
    - The log was not triggered, indicating that the `handleSubmit` function in `SignupPage.tsx` was not being called.
    - The issue was likely related to the form submission not being triggered correctly.

## Name Change

1.  **Problem:** The application was named "QuizMaster" and needed to be renamed to "Guhuza Quiz".
2.  **Action:**
    - Searched for all occurrences of "QuizMaster" and replaced them with "Guhuza Quiz".

## Current Status

The application is now running, and the navigation issues on the profile page have still not been resolved. The signup page issue is also still under investigation.
